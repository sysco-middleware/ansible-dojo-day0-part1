## Tasks

- Help your team complete any challenge (1-5) which still remains unsolved
- Convert the playbooks into ansible roles and create a proper structure with
  a generic playbook which uses those roles and where we can choose which web server
  to install via tagging
- Test & demo your code using the Katacoda environment

## Optional Tasks

Get some extra points by:

- Creating a release branch out of "develop" and investigating how to squash and rename
  commits down to only a few, for example: "dojo-day0-part1, dojo-day0-part2"
- Discussing advantages and disadvantages of GitFlow branching strategy
- Removing the manual step from challenge 5 by adding an automated task in the ansible role
